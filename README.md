# File Stager

A simple yet powerful VS Code extension that allows you to **copy files and folders** from the VS Code Explorer and paste them directly anywhere

## Problem

By default, VS Code only allows you to copy the _path_ of a file or its text content.
This makes it impossible to directly paste files into other applications like web browsers, email clients, or desktop folders.

## Solution

**File Stager** bridges this gap. Select files or folders in VS Code, copy them, and paste them **anywhere**, including your file system, web applications, or other programs that accept file drops.

## Features

- **Copy Files:** Copies actual file objects, not just text paths.
- **Batch Support:** Works with multiple selected files and folders.
- **Keyboard Shortcut:** Use `Ctrl+Alt+C` (Windows) or `Cmd+Alt+C` (Mac) for instant copying.
- **Cross-Platform:** Supports Windows (PowerShell) and macOS (AppleScript).

## How to Use

1. Select one or more files/folders in the VS Code Explorer.
2. Right-click and select **"Copy Files (System Clipboard)"**.
3. OR use the shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+C`.
4. Paste (`Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V`) in any application that supports file drops, including browsers, cloud storage interfaces, or email clients.
